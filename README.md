# Basic Language Model

This is a very simple language model implemented in Python. It uses tokenization and bigram frequency to generate new sentences based on sample text input.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic introduction to building a language model using Python. It takes a sample text, splits it into individual words, and creates a bigram frequency dictionary. Based on this dictionary, it generates a sentence by randomly selecting words.

## How It Works

1. **Tokenization**: The input text is split into individual words.
2. **Bigram Frequency**: It builds a frequency table of word pairs (bigrams).
3. **Sentence Generation**: A new sentence is generated based on the bigrams, with each word randomly chosen based on its previous word.

## Example

Here is an example of how the model might generate a sentence:


## Usage

To run the project:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Copy the `language_model.py` file and run it using Python:
    ```bash
    python language_model.py
    ```
3. The script will generate a random sentence based on the provided text input.
